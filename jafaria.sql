If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

Please do let me know if any of those day she recited the additional 15 min so i can update her grade.\nFor this week''s assignment, I have attached a template check list which will provide me with adequate information to give the correct grade.\nAgain I apologize for any misunderstanding and look forward to working with you.

If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

The email is built in such a way where it is inserted into a template that contains a footer and an image header to make the email look professional. \n\nOnce again, I apologize for this long email and I am also very excited to have all of you on our team and may Allah (swt) and the Ahlul Bayt (AS) guide us and help us in accomplishing our mission.\n\nWasalam', 0, 'Specific Teachers', '2014-11-10 10:36:20', '[]'),
(1067, 33, 3, 'Hasan Zahed', 'mzahed786110@gmail.com', 'murtaza.1993@outlook.com', 'Teacher Dashboard', 'Salam Everyone,\n\nYou are receiving this emails as you have recently joined the faculty of Jafaria Education Center\n\nFirst of all, I just want to say how excited I am about having such a dedicated team in this years Sunday School. I am very confident that if we work together and give it our best, we will InshAllah be successful in educating this next generation. \n\nI wanted to send this message to show and/or remind everyone about our Teacher Dashboard. This Dashboard is there so we can interact closely with the parents and students. To make this work, we need all of you to be active in using this dashboard on a weekly basis and to update homework grades, projects, test results, etc. I have added some instructions below to help some of our new teachers with navigating the dashboard. \n\nFirst, go to the following link and login. http://jafariaschool.org/student\nThe default username is first initial last name and the default password is firstname_lastname\nFor example if my name is Hasan Zahed, my username would be hzahed and my password would be hasan_zahed. The firs thing everyone should do is login and change their password for security purposes. http://screencast.com/t/kt5Uce0A\n\nYou can view the students enrolled in the classes you are assigned to teach be clicking on the class button on the left panel. Form there you can select the class you wan to view and the student list will be displayed - \nhttp://screencast.com/t/4sC4ui5EaLm\n\nNext up is the task screen. To access this screen, simply click on the task button on the left. Once there, from the dropdown select the class you want to add the task for. Under Task List, there will be a list of all your past Tasks that you have assigned. Click Add to add a new Task. You can select the type of task, the title, the content and when it is due. Click save to save the task  (We are working on adding an functionality where we will email the parents of the students when a task is assigned to them. http://screencast.com/t/xbiILINXrj\n\nWe have also added the ability to change the weights of the different tasks. For example you can change the weights to reflect homework being weighted more than attendance if you wanted to. The only thing is to make sure all the percentages add up to 100. http://screencast.com/t/tttGFqYPtcoP\n\nTo make things simpler, we will be taking attendance only once a day. Attendance will be taken in the 11-1130 classes. The only teachers responsible for taking attendance are the teachers teaching the 11-1130 classes. To take attendance, click on the attendance button on the left, and select the level class you are teaching. Click Add and confirm the date for the attendance. Click on the Update Button to take attendance. A list will be displayed and you can mark if a student s either present or absent. http://screencast.com/t/wAG3qcpk8oDN\n\nThe last thing of this very long email (sorry) is Email. We have built in a email functionality where a teacher can email the principal, the administrator, fellow teachers, parents of students that are assigned to them. You have an option of emailing every parent of students assigned to your class or specific parents. For example if I am teaching class 4 I can email all parents of students in Class 4. The email is built in such a way where it is inserted into a template that contains a footer and an image header to make the email look professional. \n\nOnce again, I apologize for this long email and I am also very excited to have all of you on our team and may Allah (swt) and the Ahlul Bayt (AS) guide us and help us in accomplishing our mission.\n\nWasalam', 0, 'Specific Teachers', '2014-11-10 10:45:21', '[]'),

The checklist is  a super simple tool to log the number of minutes your student reads Quran every day. \n\nIntermediate 1, Intermediate 2, and Advanced Quran students are required to read at least 15 minutes of Quran everyday and it is a part of their grade. If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

The checklist is  a super simple tool to log the number of minutes your student reads Quran every day. \n\nIntermediate 1, Intermediate 2, and Advanced Quran students are required to read at least 15 minutes of Quran everyday and it is a part of their grade. If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

Please see below for a sample:\n\nSalam Alykum, my name is __________ and my hero is _______________.  He/she is my hero because __________________.  I would want to be like her/him because___________.\n\nI will need each child to have their hero picked out and memorized by Sunday March 29, 2015.\n\nWe dont want it to be too long, as there will be other presentations that day. Please send your child in shalwar kameez for the day of presentations. More details will be sent later.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email me at Samena@premjees.com or call me at (949) 331-6259. \n\nThank you,\nSamena Premjee \nClass 2\n', 0, 'All Parents of Class (2)', '2015-03-01 19:58:07', '[]'),

The students were told that there will be 20 multiple choice and t/f questions. They were also given 3 essay questions that they should prepare for and what they should mention in their answers but only 2 of the 3 questions will be on the test.\n\nWhy do we need prophets? Why can we not function religiously function without them? (I told the students that they should talk about more in depth how prophets are expert teachers, a reminder, spiritual leaders, an example for us all, and receivers of divine revelations) How do we know that the person claiming to be a prophet is a prophet (through miracles). Pg 19-21\nHow do we know that God is just ( we went over how zulm is the opposite of adalat amd why god doesn''t need to do zulm; also make the separation between gods justice and how its different from equality? Why is god being just an important quality of god? ( students were told to mention how there wont be a qiyamaat or people would not get rewarded or punished accordingly if god wasn''t just and so on). pg 14-17\nThis question is similar to the first one and on imamat and how does this differe from prophethoot? (students were told to discuss how imams are needed to guard the religion whereas prophets expanded and spread it; they are also political leaders, proof of Allahs mercy). How are imams appointed? How do we know a person claiming to be an imam is an imam (miracles). pg. 26-28\n\nAs for the multiple choice questions it students were told they will be based from the whole book and we went over sample questions.\n', 0, 'Specific Parents', '2015-05-11 19:20:10', '[]'),
