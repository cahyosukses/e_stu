In exchange, I only ask for respect for others in the class and myself by observing COMPLETE HIJAB (as part of the madressa dress code), finishing the assigned tasks on time and actively participating in classroom discussions.\n\nKeeping in mind that both Fiqh and Aqaid are tough subjects to teach and learn, I plan to structure the class mainly around open discussion to encourage critical thinking and application in our daily lives. As we discuss Fiqh lessons, I will ask each student to think of potential questions that may arise and research the answer to those questions from a reliable source (I will let them know what these are). \nFor Aqaid, we will not only discuss some of the fundamental beliefs of our religion, but also delve deeper into the reason for those beliefs and compare them with other monotheistic religions as well as discuss similarities and differences between Islamic Schools of Thought.\n\nWe''ve only had 1 official class and I''m already excited and encouraged by some of the discussions/questions that came up!

As we discuss Fiqh lessons, I will ask each student to think of potential questions that may arise and research the answer to those questions from a reliable source (I will let them know what these are). \nFor Aqaid, we will not only discuss some of the fundamental beliefs of our religion, but also delve deeper into the reason for those beliefs and compare them with other monotheistic religions as well as discuss similarities and differences between Islamic Schools of Thought.\n\nWe''ve only had 1 official class and I''m already excited and encouraged by some of the discussions/questions that came up!

The email is built in such a way where it is inserted into a template that contains a footer and an image header to make the email look professional. \n\nOnce again, I apologize for this long email and I am also very excited to have all of you on our team and may Allah (swt) and the Ahlul Bayt (AS) guide us and help us in accomplishing our mission.\n\nWasalam', 0, 'All Teachers', '2014-09-21 17:33:29', ''),

If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks.

The students will have a more subjective exam where they will be required to wipe detailed answers.\n\nFor grade 6: brother Murtaza & Izhar, Please let me know how far you have completed from Tenets of Islam so can prepare accordingly. The exam will be more objective so make sure the understand the concepts.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this.\n\nJazakAllah for your efforts and May Allah accept your hard work.\n\nYa Ali.\nMohamed Taha Dharsi', 0, 'Teacher Classroom', '2015-01-05 13:26:05', '[]'),

If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

To make this work, we need all of you to be active in using this dashboard on a weekly basis and to update homework grades, projects, test results, etc. I have added some instructions below to help some of our new teachers with navigating the dashboard. \n\nFirst, go to the following link and login. http://jafariaschool.org/student\nThe default username is first initial last name and the default password is firstname_lastname\nFor example if my name is Hasan Zahed, my username would be hzahed and my password would be hasan_zahed. The firs thing everyone should do is login and change their password for security purposes. http://screencast.com/t/kt5Uce0A\n\nYou can view the students enrolled in the classes you are assigned to teach be clicking on the class button on the left panel. Form there you can select the class you wan to view and the student list will be displayed - \nhttp://screencast.com/t/4sC4ui5EaLm\n\nNext up is the task screen. To access this screen, simply click on the task button on the left. Once there, from the dropdown select the class you want to add the task for. Under Task List, there will be a list of all your past Tasks that you have assigned. Click Add to add a new Task. You can select the type of task, the title, the content and when it is due. Click save to save the task  (We are working on adding an functionality where we will email the parents of the students when a task is assigned to them. http://screencast.com/t/xbiILINXrj\n\nWe have also added the ability to change the weights of the different tasks. For example you can change the weights to reflect homework being weighted more than attendance if you wanted to. The only thing is to make sure all the percentages add up to 100. http://screencast.com/t/tttGFqYPtcoP\n\nTo make things simpler, we will be taking attendance only once a day. Attendance will be taken in the 11-1130 classes. The only teachers responsible for taking attendance are the teachers teaching the 11-1130 classes. To take attendance, click on the attendance button on the left, and select the level class you are teaching. Click Add and confirm the date for the attendance. Click on the Update Button to take attendance. A list will be displayed and you can mark if a student s either present or absent. http://screencast.com/t/wAG3qcpk8oDN\n\nThe last thing of this very long email (sorry) is Email. We have built in a email functionality where a teacher can email the principal, the administrator, fellow teachers, parents of students that are assigned to them. You have an option of emailing every parent of students assigned to your class or specific parents. For example if I am teaching class 4 I can email all parents of students in Class 4. The email is built in such a way where it is inserted into a template that contains a footer and an image header to make the email look professional. \n\nOnce again, I apologize for this long email and I am also very excited to have all of you on our team and may Allah (swt) and the Ahlul Bayt (AS) guide us and help us in accomplishing our mission.\n\nWasalam', 0, 'Specific Teachers', '2014-11-10 10:36:20', '[]'),

The checklist is  a super simple tool to log the number of minutes your student reads Quran every day. \n\nIntermediate 1, Intermediate 2, and Advanced Quran students are required to read at least 15 minutes of Quran everyday and it is a part of their grade. If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

The checklist is  a super simple tool to log the number of minutes your student reads Quran every day. \n\nIntermediate 1, Intermediate 2, and Advanced Quran students are required to read at least 15 minutes of Quran everyday and it is a part of their grade. If the parents are not filling out the checklist, the grade student''s grade for the Quran class drops every week. \n\nFor a limited time, we are giving the opportunity for the parents to go back and add the logs for previous weeks. Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]'),

Starting Feb 28th, Weekly Checklists will be due Saturday Night at 11:59 PM for the previous week and parents will not be able to go back and edit the logs.\n\nKeep in mind, we started requiring the Electronic Time sheets to be completed starting from the week of 12/21, so you are not required to fill out these sheets before then.\n\nYou can login to the dashboard by going to http://www.jafariaschool.org/student/\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.', 0, 'All Parents', '2015-01-26 11:43:17', '[]');
