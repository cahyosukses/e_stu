http://jafariaschool.org/student_test/grade_finalize?class_type_id=3&class_level_id=10

On the finalize page
the teacher should only be able to view just their subject that they are teaching not all subjects
- done

there should be a Finalize button that takes them back to the task page with the message grades finalized for class __ Subject ____
when they click on the finalize button,
- done

it should check if every student has atleast 1 comment added.
If not, it should give errors that -student name-- has no comments
- done

There should also be a save and exit button, where they can come back.
Also I feel like adding the comments is not very intuitive,
how about if the actual text are buttons and I can add them by clicking on them,
and then once they are added, I can click on them again to remove them
- done

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Administrator

There should be section on the administrator report card page similar to the handbook section,
where I can see what subjects have been finalized and what subjects have not been finalized.
So the table should look like
- done

Column :
	- Class (Which would be the number or Quran),
	- Subject (In the case of Quran it would say the level),
	- Teacher,
	- and a control to email the individual teacehr.
- done

There will also be a button to email all teachers.
The email will look like:

Dear Teacher,

You have not yet finalized the grades for the following classes:

List of the classes

Please finalize them by February 10th, 2015

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also - when I send the email, it does not have the link for the report card
