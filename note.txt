On the administrator dashboard
- we have a link to generate event,
where the administrator can say the date and time of the event
and the timeframe that each teacher is not available and is busy
and how long the time slot is for each parent.

On the Parent Dashboard
- They have a section where they have a list of the teachers of all their children.
Next to that list is teacher dropdown of the available time slots of each teacher.
The parent selects the time slots they want and click save.

The section on the parent should have the following columns:
- Teacher Name, Student Name, Subjects, Available Time Slots

The table that you build gets filled up like it does right now
and the email stuff stays the same
except if we can add a button to email all teachers and email all parents with the schedule

Notes -

So everything is the same meaning if my child has sister masooma for 2 classes,
her name is on the list only once and the multiple subjects is
listed under subjects.

The administrator
when it generates the event should have a way of picking teachers
who are not available for the meeting,
and on the parent dashboard under the available time slots for them,
it should say No Available Time Slots

The thing is I need this super urgent, by Tuesday at the latest.
I am willing to pay for the urgency
so if you can add a milestone that would be great.

Thanks
