Report Card Feature
This will be touch all three users - Teachers, Parents and Administrator

1. In the Task area, there will be a finalize button for each class the teachers teaches
- done

2. Once you click on the button,
it will redirect them to a new page (not a modal) showing the list of students, the entire list not just the first 10,
The lit will have a few columns - The student Name, The percentage and a control column, with a link to add comments
- http://jafariaschool.org/student/grade_finalize
- done

3. When you click on the add comments, a modal pops up with 2 columns
- Good and Bad
- A teacher can add as many good comments and as many bad comments as they want.
- done

1. Good comments
1. Great Work
2. Outstanding Student
3. Good Work Habits
4. Very Neat & Accurate work

12. Inconsistent effort
13. Unacceptable behavior
14. Difficulty in understanding subject matte
- done

4. On the Finalize page
There will be save and finalize button and a save and back button.
and once you click on the save and finalize button that you will go back to the task page
and instead of the finalize button there will be a text saying "Grades were finalized for this class on <Date and Time Stamp>"
- later

5. There will be a new page for the administrator login which will be called report cards.
- http://jafariaschool.org/student/report_card
That page will have a few columns.
It will be a list of parents with students enrolled.
The columns will be Father Name, Mother Name, Number of Students Enrolled, and a control column

6. On The administrator page, Under the report cards area, and under the control column,
there will be button called generate report card,
once the administrator clicks on that, we will generate a pdf file with the template

I have attached. The template is pretty self-explanatory.
For the Additional comments, we will add the numbers that relate to the text that the teachers added.
If they have multiple children, page 2 of the template will be there for each child.

Once the report is generated,
there will be additional button added under the control column that will will say view report card.
If the administrator clicks on generate again, it will overwrite the previous PDF will with the new one.
There will also be an email button for each parent, where the administrator can manually email the parent the locked PDF file,
We can add another template for how the email looks in the config area

6. On the reports card page,
there will be a Generate All button that will generate reports card for everyone
and it would be nice if when we click it shows us progress like
(Generating for parent 1 - Percentage, Generating for Parent 2)

7. Also on that page,
There will be another button called Finalize and Email all Parents
where it will generate all the report cards again,
and send an email to the father and the mother with the link to their student's report card

8. Once the administrator clicks on the Finalize and email button,
The report card is added to the Parent's dashboard in the documents area.

I am sure there will be some changes after you code it up the first time
around but if possible lets do this in the student_test first so I can give
feedback.
