Hey there,

I have another request

The school year is ending and we need to start registering for the new
year.

The first step for that is to give the parents the option to re-register
their child for next year.

What is needed:
A modal that pops up when the parent logs on to the dashboard that says:

Jafaria Sunday School has completed its first successful year. Please pick
an option below to indicate if you intend to register you child for next
year.

The options will be:
I do wish to register my child for next year
I do not wish to register my child next year
Remind me Later

If they click on Yes - Register My Child another window pops up with a
dropdown of the names of their children. If they have more than one, there
is an additional option that says all my children.

Once they choose the child, they also have a checkbox where it says I have
read and Agree to the terms and conditions specified in the student
handbook.

The student handbook word will be linked to the pdf of the student handbook

Once they check the box and click submit, they should get a message saying.
Thanks for registering your child for the 2015-2016 school year

We would need a new db table that will store all the registrations for next
year
Also on the administrator dashboard - We could replace the Handbook section
with the New Registration section

The table will have the following columns
Student Name
Father Name
Mother Name
Signed Handbook Agreement
Fees Paid - Yes/No
Date Registered

Let me know if there are any questions
