I think the pagination on the schedule list for administrator is broken,
I cant click on next page
- ok sorry, i am update about subject student and it's dont support with current paging
btw it's already fix now

Can you add a print button that basically generates a PDF of all the timeslots per teacher,
so for example one page is for a specific teacher
- ok done
