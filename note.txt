Also - We are having a parent teacher conference next week
and I was wondering if we can make a scheduling system.
For example, it will be a page (does not have to be on the dashboard)
that will have some criteria like :

Timeframe of the Event:
Time a Teacher is busy:
Length of time of a parent with each student:

and with that we can generate a schedule where every parent can talk to the teacher of their students.
The goal is to make it so the parents dont have to stay for a long time
and can talk to all the teachers at once
and be done rather than having a meeting in the morning
and then the next meeting be in the afternoon

For Example:

Timeframe of the Event: 10:30 AM - 3PM
Time a Teacher is busy: Taha Dharsi 11:30 - 3:00
Length of time of a parent with each student: 10 minutes

With that we will schedule time for the parents
where each parent will meet with the teacher of their students for 10 minutes each.

The interface would look like this

The columns would be Time Frame, Father Name, Mother Name, Teacher

There will be a button
where we could email each parent and let them know of their schedule
and also email each teacher and let them know of their schedule as well
